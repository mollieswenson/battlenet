<h1 id="core-values">Core Values</h1>
<p>Here's how technical writers can apply Blizzard's eight code values.</p>
<h3 id="gameplay-first">Gameplay First</h3>
<p>This core value aims to deliver an incredible gaming experience to as many people as possible. Technical writers can contribute to this by producing documentation that supports others in delivering, maintaining, and consuming Blizzard games. Great documentation helps developers deliver quality games faster, helps server administrators maintain the services that support those games, and helps end users download, install, and run games quickly and without frustration.    </p>
<h3 id="commit-to-quality">Commit to Quality</h3>
<p>This core value highlights the importance of carefully considering the task at hand, focusing on details, and leveraging feedback to produce an exceptional product. Technical writers can apply these same techniques by approaching each stage of documentation project, from inception through delivery, with careful planning. Each project should include detailed analysis, review, feedback, and revision at stages throughout the development process.</p>
<h3 id="play-nice-play-fair">Play Nice; Play Fair</h3>
<p>This core value insists on integrity and respect. Technical writers can put this into practice by being patient and gracious with those they interact with during the development process, and by approaching their audience with respect. It also means having the integrity to take ownership of mistakes, and taking the initiative to keep projects productive.</p>
<h3 id="embrace-your-inner-geek">Embrace your Inner Geek</h3>
<p>This core value serves as a reminder to be passionate about the things that make life awesome, share those passions with others, and take the time to see what others are excited to share with you. Technical writers can apply this by keeping up with the latest techniques and tools in technical documentation, and by maintaining an open and tolerant dialogue with colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="every-voice-matters">Every Voice Matters</h3>
<p>This core value recognizes that anyone can have a great idea, and encourages everyone to speak up and contribute to the conversation. Technical writers have a great opportunity to grow from feedback and criticism, and should always encourage others to give their honest opinion about documentation processes and results. The best way to create exceptionally useful and engaging documentation is to gather and carefully consider feedback and criticism.</p>
<h3 id="think-globally">Think Globally</h3>
<p>This core value helps to ensure the global community feels welcome, and endorses an inclusive culture. Technical writers can apply this by writing their documentation with localization in mind. Clarity, consistency, and consideration for cultural differences makes for documentation that helps a global audience feel included and important.</p>
<h3 id="lead-responsibly">Lead Responsibly</h3>
<p>This core value aims to lead responsibly by making ethical decisions, always keeping players in mind, and setting a strong example within the company and within the industry. Technical writers can lead responsibly by setting a strong example and by mentoring others who participate in documentation. Technical writers should always consider their audience's knowledge level, and strive to address their audience with respect and honesty.</p>
<h3 id="learn-and-grow">Learn and Grow</h3>
<p>This core value highlights the importance of continued growth; professionally, personally, as a company, and as an industry. Technical writers can practice this by exploring new tools, techniques, and technologies, and by being open to new ways of developing and delivering documentation. Additionally, technical writers can share what they learn with others inside and outside their field to promote a culture of sharing and learning.  </p></div>
